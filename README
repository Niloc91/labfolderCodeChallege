For this task I am assuming that this only relates to the 
lab entries and does not take into lab entries assigned to particular users.

A simple database structure was designed with the key information which was to 
stored and a REST API designed based on on operations that would be carried out(CRUD).

 I have assumed that a number of different lab entries would be added in and the word search
for similar and identical words was updated to report back on the position of the word(s)
based on the entry id and the position in the entry data. The entry data was stored as a String
array for simplicity with the array positions returned for identical and similar words in a
map which shows the lab entry it was assigned to and the position in that entry.

End points have been given below.
